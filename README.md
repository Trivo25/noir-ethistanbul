# NOIR Plume Nullifier

very naive implementation of https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1255.pdf
the goal was to play around with noir and submit a project so that I get my staked Eth back :D
rather than to get a functional implementation going - so no need to waste your time and judge this project!
theres many mistakes in the implementation, some outright breaking the security of the scheme
